## üìú License

WrangleBot is released under the GPL-3.0 License. For more information, please view the license. You must publish all changes and modifications to the source code under the same license. We encourage you to contribute to the project and make it better for everyone.

If you want to use the Cloud Syncing features and your company has more than $500,000 in revenue, you may need to register with us to acquire an enterprise license. Additionally, if you want to develop the engine or interface with proprietary features without re-releasing as LGPL, you will need to register for a commercial license. However, you are free to use the plugin system to code workflows, and it is unlikely that you will need to make drastic changes to the engine unless you require your own cloud database system or machine learning integrations.
