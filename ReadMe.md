## üëã Getting Started

To build WrangleBot, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer.

### üì¶ Install

Create a new folder and clone the repository into it. Then, run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies. After that, run `npm run build` to build the application. Finally, run `npm run test` to start the application.

Alternatively you can use npm to install wranglebot using `npm install wranglebot` in your newly created folder.

### üõ† Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### üöÄ Start WrangleBot in test environment

```bash
npm run test
```

‚ö†Ô∏è You will require a `.env` to run the test environment:

```dotenv
CLOUD_SYNC_DATABASE_TOKEN="xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx" #please contact for developer token
CLOUD_SYNC_DATABASE_URL="https://db2.wranglebot.io"
CLOUD_ML_URL="https://ai.wranglebot.io" # you will need a positive credits balance, you can charge your wallet at wranglebot.io
DEBUG_NOTIFICATIONS="false" #show notifications in console
```

## ü™® Offline Mode

If you are not using Cloud Sync, then you can use the offline mode. This mode will allow you to use WrangleBot without an internet connection. To use the offline mode, you will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. The `.env` file should contain the following:

> Note: You will not be able to use AI Services in offline mode, as they are tied to your Cloud Sync account. If you need to migrate an offline database to Cloud Sync please write us an email at [a.rothe@vanrothe.com](mailto:a.rothe@vanrothe.com)

```dotenv
DATABASE_KEY="xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
```

The key can be any string of characters.

## Starting via NodeJS

```js
wranglebot.open({
  client: {
    database: {
      cloud: {
        token: "<YOUR_DATABASE_TOKEN>",
        databaseURL: "https://db2.wranglebot.io",
        machineLearningURL: "https://ai.wranglebot.io",
      },
    },
    port: 3200,
  }
})
```


```js
wranglebot.open({
  client: {
    database: {
      local: {
        key: "<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>"
      },
    },
    port: 3200,

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Data Privacy Concerns
### Read Before Using!

As of right now, WrangleBot is still in development. This means that there are some limitations to what WrangleBot can do.

**These limitations are as follows:**

- WrangleBot **Cloud Sync does not yet utilize end-to-end encryption** to protect your data, but uses TLS-Encryption to communicate and send data between you and the cloud sync servers. This means that **your data is encrypted while it is in transit, but not while it is stored on the cloud sync servers**.

We are committed to addressing these limitations and implementing new features as soon as possible. We are also committed to protecting your data and privacy. We will never sell your data to third parties, and we will never use your data for any other purpose than to provide you with the best possible experience with WrangleBot. Please review our data [privacy policy here](https://wranglebot.io/privacy) for more information.
